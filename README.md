# userstory
This project is  an application that shows a table of information. 
When the user loads the page, they should see a table presented. 
When you click on the header of a table column, it will sort the table in ascending and descending order.
# Pre requisites
You need git to clone the repository.
# Install Dependencies
We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help us manage and test the application.

We get the tools we depend upon via npm, the Node package manager.
We get the Angular code via bower, a client-side code package manager.

We have preconfigured npm to automatically run bower so we can simply do:
npm install

# Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start this server is:

npm start
